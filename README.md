This repository is my digital notebook of structured learning journey in Core Java
It is dedicated to building deep expertise in Core Java through structured practice, concept clarity, and clean code implementation.

Each topic is organized systematically and includes:
Concept explanation (written in my own words)
Syntax breakdown
Well-commented code examples
Practical understanding of how and why it works

The goal is not just to write code — but to understand it deeply

This repository helps you understand Core Java concepts clearly through practical, well-commented examples, strengthen your fundamentals step-by-step, and use it as a structured resource for quick revision.
