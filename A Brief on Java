                    A BRIEF ON JAVA
============================================================
🔹 1. What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and currently maintained by Oracle Corporation.

It follows the principle:
👉 Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)

Because Java code compiles into bytecode, which runs on the JVM.

🔹 2. How Java Works 
Execution Flow:

.java file → written by developer

javac compiler → converts into .class (bytecode)

JVM executes bytecode

Why Platform Independent?

Because:

Bytecode runs on JVM

JVM is platform-dependent

Java program is platform-independent

🔹 3. JDK vs JRE vs JVM
Component	Purpose
JDK	Development kit (Compiler + JRE + Tools)
JRE	Runtime environment (JVM + Libraries)
JVM	Executes bytecode

👉 JVM handles memory management, garbage collection, and execution.

🔹 4. Why Java is Fast?

Even though Java is not as fast as C++, it performs efficiently because:

✔ JIT Compiler

Converts bytecode into native machine code

Optimizes frequently executed code (HotSpot optimization)

✔ Garbage Collection

Automatic memory management

Removes unused objects

✔ Multithreading

Executes multiple threads simultaneously

🔹 5. OOP Concepts in Java (Very Important)
1️⃣ Encapsulation

Binding data and methods together.
Achieved using:

Classes

Private variables

Getters & Setters

2️⃣ Abstraction

Hiding internal implementation.
Achieved using:

Abstract classes

Interfaces

3️⃣ Inheritance

One class acquires properties of another.
Using extends keyword.

4️⃣ Polymorphism

One method behaves differently.

Compile-time → Method Overloading

Runtime → Method Overriding

🔹 6. Difference: Abstract Class vs Interface
Abstract Class	Interface
Can have constructors	Cannot have constructors
Can have normal methods	Only abstract methods (before Java 8)
Supports single inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
🔹 7. Memory Structure in JVM

JVM Memory Areas:

Heap → Objects

Stack → Method calls & local variables

Method Area → Class metadata

PC Register

Native Method Stack

👉 Objects are created in Heap.
👉 Method calls go into Stack.

🔹 8. What is Garbage Collection?

Automatic memory cleanup process.

When:

Object has no reference

JVM removes it automatically

Types:

Serial GC

Parallel GC

G1 GC

🔹 9. Exception Handling

Used to handle runtime errors.

Keywords:

try

catch

finally

throw

throws

Types:

Checked Exception (Compile-time)

Unchecked Exception (Runtime)

🔹 10. Multithreading

Java supports concurrent execution using:

Thread class

Runnable interface

Executor framework

Benefits:

Better CPU utilization

Faster execution

Background processing

🔹 11. Important Java Keywords (Interview Favorites)

static

final

this

super

volatile

transient

🔹 12. Collections Framework

Interfaces:

List

Set

Map

Queue

Common Classes:

ArrayList

LinkedList

HashSet

HashMap

TreeMap

👉 HashMap allows one null key.
👉 HashSet does not allow duplicates.

🔹 13. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
String	StringBuilder	StringBuffer
Immutable	Mutable	Mutable
Slow for modification	Fast	Thread-safe
🔹 14. Why Java is Secure?

No pointer access

Bytecode verification

Security manager

Automatic memory management

🔹 15. Java Editions

Java SE

Java EE (Now Jakarta EE)

Java ME


“Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language that runs on the JVM. It uses bytecode and JIT compilation for optimized execution. It supports OOP principles like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Java provides automatic memory management through garbage collection and supports multithreading for high performance. Because of its security, portability, and strong ecosystem, it is widely used in enterprise and backend development.”
